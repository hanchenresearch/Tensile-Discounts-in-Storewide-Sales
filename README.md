# Tensile Discounts in Storewide Sales

This repo is made for the Monte Carlo simulations of the storewide sale tensile discount policy that were reported in Web Appendix E. The codes can be accessed in this [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/hanchenresearch/Tensile-Discounts-in-Storewide-Sales/blob/main/Policy%20Simulation_build2(binomial)-10000sims.ipynb). Simulations were performed using Python (Python 3.7.7, NumPy 1.21.5, Pandas 1.3.4, SciPy 1.7.3) on Linux servers hosting 88 Intel Xeon (Cascade Lake) CPU cores and 1.5 TB of RAM. The full loop of simulations across all discount distributions ran for 40 hours.
